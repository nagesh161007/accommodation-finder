# Accommodation Finder

## Project description

The goal of this project is to build a database that will aid students looking for both temporary and permanent accommodation. Users/Students (hosts) can publish their apartments with the dates it will be available, and students can search for rooms based on their preferences make reservations for temporary accommodation, and contact with the host for permanent accommodation.

### Brief Overview

Hosts will be able to offer their currently rented apartments for permanent housing and short-term housing with their preferences for housemates, apartment images, a video tour, move-in dates, house rules, nearby utilities stores, and method of commuting to school. By using filters based on preferences for room type, hall place, members of the house with matching courses, and university, users will be able to locate permanent or temporary accommodation. Users will be able to view information on members, such as the courses they are enrolled in, their states, their languages, and their contact information, subject to host approval. Users looking for lodging are divided into free and premium subscription plans, which only allow them to access the contact details of the property's host.

### DB Functionalities

1.Host will be able to host their accommodations with move-in dates, rent for the person, number of open spots, photos, an apartment video tour, address, room spot type, apartment info (bed and bath information), laundry access, and preferences for house members (state, food, language, course, university, and no smoking/alcohol). 2. Users can focus their search for rooms based on attributes including location, dates of stay, and preferences for both temporary and permanent postings. 3. Based on the user's recorded choices and available dates, accommodations will be displayed. 4. Users will be able to book and cancel temporary accommodation as well as pay for their stay. 5. For permanent accommodation, users will have access to the host's contact information, but there will be time and property contact limit restrictions depending on the user subscription plan. 6. Users can bookmark accommodation listings to view at a later time. 7. Users will be notified of new listings if the property matches their criteria. 8. Reviews of temporary accommodations can include ratings and remarks 9. Rent will be categorized based on the spot type, sharing, private rooms with brokerage, deposit if applicable 10. Members of the house can be either user or if signup as user which will be matched based on email and contact information 11. Students looking for temporary and permanent can also post their requests

### Entities Overview

Each listing will have information related to accommodation type, rent, room type(bed room, shared, private or hall spot), number of guests it can accommodate, vacancies, price, address, photos, amenities and rating and reviews (optional), cancellation policy (temporary accommodation), gender preference, contact information, listing type, house rules

### Assignment 3

Assignment 3 - Gathering, Scraping, Munging and Cleaning Data

Tables

Permanent Accommodation - permanent accommodations posted in whatsapp groups with rent, starting date, roomtype, gender, location and the user contact and name who posted it.

Temporary Accommodation - temporary accommodations posted in whatsapp groups with rent, starting date, ending data, roomtype, gender, location and the user contact and name who posted it.

User - user name and user contact which is used as primary key for identifying which user posted the accommodation

Data gathering

Dataset - Realworld data for Temporary and permanent accommodation csv file gathered from whatsapp groups, google forms and scrapped from websites for permanent accommodations

Datasets gathered as csv files from whatsapp are imported as pandas dataframe to clean and validate

permanent and temporary accommodations dataframe shape and info are displayed for data types

Rent column in data frame are cleaned by removing dollar symbols and trailing spaces and made as type int for both temporary and permanent accommodations

Missing values for rent are filled with mean value from the data frame

Missing values for str are replaced with empty strings

After all data is cleaned all dataframe columns are casted into respective data types

Data visualisation

Data is visualised with matplotlib libary on four use cases

Temporary accommodation use case

1. Number of temporary accommodation based on locality with histgrams

2. Accommodation availability based on gender using piechart

3. Accommodation availbilty based on spot type using piechart

4. Scatter plot to visualise the rent range distribution accross localities

Importing data to database

Data is inserted to respective tables from their dataframes using sqlalchemy

Updated database Schema
